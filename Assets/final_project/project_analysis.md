### ðŸ“Š NHS Workforce Data Analysis Using SQL

This project focuses on the analysis of NHS workforce data using SQL to extract meaningful insights into staffing patterns, role distribution, and temporal trends across different staff groups. By leveraging structured queries, the analysis enables filtering, aggregation, and segmentation of large datasets to identify key workforce dynamicsâ€”such as the growth or decline of specific roles, proportional changes in staff categories, and yearly variations in overall headcount. The ultimate objective is to transform raw data into actionable intelligence that can support strategic workforce planning, resource allocation, and policy decision-making within the healthcare sector.

            THEN Value 
            ELSE 0 
        END) * 100.0 / SUM(Value) AS Infrastructure_Support_Percentage
FROM [Workforce].[dbo].[nhs-workforce-data-june-2022]
GROUP BY Time
ORDER BY Time;
```

In June 2022, the NHS workforce was predominantly composed of staff in direct patient care and support roles. The largest group was Nurses & Health Visitors, with over 2.1 million staff, followed closely by Support to Doctors, Nurses & Midwives, which included nearly 1.9 million individuals. Scientific, Therapeutic & Technical Staff and Ambulance Staff were also significant, comprising over 1 million and 1.1 million staff respectively. HCHS Doctors accounted for approximately 797,000 employees.

Beyond clinical roles, substantial numbers were employed in operational and support areas such as Central Functions (680,000), Hotel, Property & Estates (442,000), and Support to ST&T Staff (502,000), highlighting the broad infrastructure supporting healthcare delivery. Leadership roles included around 145,000 Managers and 77,000 Senior Managers. Smaller groups included Midwives (156,000) and an Unknown category with fewer than 3,000 staff. Overall, the data reflects the NHS's reliance not just on medical professionals, but on a diverse and expansive workforce that enables the system to function at scale.
