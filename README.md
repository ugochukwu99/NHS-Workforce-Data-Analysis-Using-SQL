# 📊 NHS Workforce Data Analysis Using SQL

# 🧾 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing NHS workforce data using SQL to uncover trends, workforce distribution, and staff group insights over time. The goal is to use structured queries to filter, aggregate, and interpret the data, supporting data-driven understanding of NHS staffing patterns.

# 🛠️ Tools and Features Used
📌 Tools
This project was carried out using SQL as the primary tool for data analysis. All queries were executed within a relational database management system (RDBMS) using SQL Server. The queries were written, tested, and managed using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), a powerful integrated environment for working with SQL Server databases. Although the analysis was primarily SQL-based, Microsoft Excel was optionally used for initial data exploration and inspection.

The project made extensive use of core SQL features including:
SELECT – to retrieve data from the dataset.
WHERE – to filter rows based on specified conditions (e.g., role group, ethnicity).
GROUP BY – to group records for aggregation (e.g., by year or staff group).
Aggregate functions like SUM() and MAX() – to calculate totals and find peak values.
CASE WHEN – for conditional aggregation (e.g., counting specific staff types).
ORDER BY – to sort results by time or group.
String functions like LEFT() – to extract the year from the date column (Time).
