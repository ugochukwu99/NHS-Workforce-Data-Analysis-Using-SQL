### ðŸ“Š NHS Workforce Data Analysis Using SQL

This project focuses on the analysis of NHS workforce data using SQL to extract meaningful insights into staffing patterns, role distribution, and temporal trends across different staff groups. By leveraging structured queries, the analysis enables filtering, aggregation, and segmentation of large datasets to identify key workforce dynamicsâ€”such as the growth or decline of specific roles, proportional changes in staff categories, and yearly variations in overall headcount. The ultimate objective is to transform raw data into actionable intelligence that can support strategic workforce planning, resource allocation, and policy decision-making within the healthcare sector.
